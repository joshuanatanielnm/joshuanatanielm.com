I started my programming journey by learning low-level languages like C and C++. Then, I created my first web application using PHP and Laravel. In 2019, I was introduced to Javascript by the [SurabayaJS](https://surabayajs.org/) community. Since then, I have had the privilege of building software for agencies, startups, and communities.

Currently I spend more time exploring Blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence âœ¨
