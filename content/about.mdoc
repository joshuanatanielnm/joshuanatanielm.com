Hey there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Joshua and I am a software engineer that specialized in frontend development. I have experience contributing and leading multiple projects such as Social Media Applications, Marketing sites, Internal Dashboards, Data Visualization sites, and Decentralize Applications. I find satisfaction developing digital products that performant and have a nice user experience.&nbsp;

Born and raised in&nbsp;[ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Surabaya, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya). Received my bachelor's degree on Informatics at&nbsp;[Institut Teknologi Adhi Tama Surabaya](https://itats.ac.id/)&nbsp;on 2023. Currently working as a frontend developer, and organized&nbsp;[SurabayaJS](https://surabayajs.org/).

I started my programming journey in 2018 by learning low-level languages (C and C++) while studying at my college. I began exploring a lot of things, from web development, mobile development, and AR (Augmented Reality) creating instagram filters using Spark AR studio for fun. Technology is very interesting to me because I can pour my creativity into it.

In 2019, I focused on web development, developing various products using PHP and Laravel. Then, I was introduced to Javascript by the [SurabayaJS](https://surabayajs.org/) community, and put more time into mastering it. Since then, I have had the privilege of building software for agencies, startups, and communities.
