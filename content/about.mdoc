Started my programming journey in 2018 while in college, by learning low-level languages like C and C++. Then, I began exploring a lot of things, from web development, mobile development, and VR as well. Technology is very interesting to me because I can pour my creativity into it.

In 2019, I focused on web development, developing various products using PHP and Laravel. Then, I was introduced to JavaScript by the [SurabayaJS](https://surabayajs.org/) community, and put more time into mastering it. Since then, I have had the privilege of building software for agencies, startups, and communities.

Born and raised in&nbsp;[**ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©** Surabaya, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya). Majored my bachelor's degree on Informatics at&nbsp;[Institut Teknologi Adhi Tama Surabaya](https://itats.ac.id/)&nbsp;on 2022. Currently working as a frontend developer, and organized&nbsp;[SurabayaJS.](https://surabayajs.org/)

In the meantime, I spent more time exploring Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. âœ¨
